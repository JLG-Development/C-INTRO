@Description: Review Questions from CHP_3 of Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, Bjarne Stroustrup

-----------------------------
*Note from the author*
I wrote the answer out on paper first and transfered them over after I was done so I could work on them while
I was on cq at the 315th TRS.

[1] What is a computation?

    A computation is a calculation or logical expression that does with/too i/o data.


[2] What do we mean by inputs and outputs to a computation?

    I/O in ragrds to computation refers to input data being modified to produce output data. The 
    modification(computation) refers to a method, function, or block statement (or a ragard to simpler
    computation, a singluar statement (1 line expression)) that handles and changes input data to produce
    desired output data.


[3] What are the three requirements a programmer should keep in mind when expression computations?


[4] What does an expresion do?


[5] What is the difference between a statement and an expression, as described in this chapter?


[6] What is an lvalue? List the operators that require an lvalue. Why do these operators, and not the others, require an lvalue?


[7] What is a constant expression?


[8] What is a literal?


[9] What is a symbolic constant and why do we use them?


[10] What is a magic constant?


[11] What are some operators we can use for integers and floating-point values?


[12] What are some operatores that can be used on integers and not flaoting-point values?


[13] What are some operators that can be used for strings?


[14] When would a programmer prefer a switch-statement to an if-statement?


[15] What are some common problems with switch-statements?


[16] What is a function of each part of the header line in a for-loop, and in what sequence are they executed?


[17] When should the for-loop be used and when should the while-loop be used?


[18] Describe what the line char foo(int x) means in a function definition?


[19] When should you define a seperate functio for pat of a program? List reasons.


[20] What can you do to an int that you cannot do to a string?


[21] What can you do to a string that you cannot do to an int?


[22] What is the index of the third element of a vector?


[23] How do you write a for-loop that prints every element of a vector?


[24] What does vector<char> alphabet(26); do?


[25] Describe what push_back() does to a vector.


[26] What does vector's member size() do?


[27] What make a vector so popular/useful?


[28] How do you sort the elements of a vector?

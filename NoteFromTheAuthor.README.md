Dear mom, dad, and family. I know im going through a lot right now. And most of my sessions come across as hopeless.
They are mainly just venting as the past 2 years have been a living hell for me. Let this folder of projects
be the proof in the pudding that I will never stop fighting for my country, and striving to achieve my dreams. This is me
finishing college so I can commision now that I have to wait two years. Just switching to back up plan while
plan a is put on hold so we continue progressing. When knocked down I will get back up every freaking time. 
By the grace of God I will not get knocked down like I have now with all the gut injuries.
It sucks, but i will make it through, and I will make this world a better place. Thank you for listening to all my griping
and everything else. I can definetely be a bitch about it at times. 

We will see how this journey plays out.

Dear MOM, Dad, and Jeff, I am switching gears from software to cybersecurity with an electrical engineering minor.
I intend to be doing some black ops stuff, and I will have intel, SR, and a cyber security and electrical engineering
degree under my belt before i commision. I said I intend to make a difference and I really do. I will try
and talk with the ccs guy at the SCIF and see how he recommends going about this. Love you guys much. I have
my appointment tomorrow. Lots of love and keep kicking ass.

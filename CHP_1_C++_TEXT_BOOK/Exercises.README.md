*Note from the author*

Please note that while I goign back through an introductory text book on c++,
I am still an intermediate programmer. I understand most major concepts. 
I primarily programmed in java, so objects oriented pgrams come easier than functional programming. 
I feel that I will gain a better understanding of c++, and function programming as a whole if I go back to the basics
and quickly catch up by speeding through the pages of a textbook.

Exercises for CHP 1 C++ Text Book.

Source Code:

#include <iostream>;

int main(){
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
    return 0;
}

+----------------------------------------------------+
All the answers to my reviews question are structured into different functions in exerciseQuestions.cpp if necessary.
+----------------------------------------------------+

1. Change the program to out the two lines, "Hello Programming!" and "Here we go!".
    -The source code for this question can be found in the fucntion exerciseOne();

2. Write a program that gives precise instructions (as if you were talking to a computer) to find the upstairs bathroom.
    -The source doe for this question can be in the function exerciseTwo();

3. Write a definition for each of the follow terms listed below.
    -Function
        A function is a set of instructions specific to a task the computer is to complete.
    -output
        The information or task that is produced by a function.
        Can also refer specifically to text written in the terminal.
    -compiler
        A compiler is a program that translates cource code into machine code.
    -error
        An error is a problem/mistake in the code preventing it from executing or compiling properly.
        Often refurred to as a bug
    -linker
        A linker is a program that connects all the used files and source code to work properly in the executable file.
    -command lines
        Refers to the text based terminal within most operating system to interact with the computer itself
    -executable
        An executableource code that has been compiled into machine code specific to the computer and is ready to be run.
    -object code
        Object code is code that has been compiled into machine code but is not ready to be run until the linker has connected
        all the source code files to be used together.
    -comment
        A comment is a line of text within the code that is used to explain code to human readers.
        Comments are ignored by the compiler and are necessary for readability.
    -import
        Allows access and use of another library/users source code for use in another file.
    -librarys
        A collection of source code to be used by other programmers.
    -module
        A Module is a specific chunk or unit of code within a program compiled seperatly to be linked with the rest of the program in the .exe file.
    -bug
        A bug is a defect in the code that prevents the program from running properly.
    -main(){}
        -The main function is the starting point of a program. The first function or in the case of obects, method to be ran.
    -C++
        C++ is a programming language typically used to develop operating sytems and video games.
    -IDE
        IDE is an integrated development environment, a software application used to develop software.
        It provides programmers with most the tools they will need to create programs.
    -Source Code
        Source code is the text that is written ina program that humans can read, write, and edit.
    -statement
        A statment is a line of code that is executed by the computer.
    -#include
        
    -debugging
    -<<
    -headfile
    -program
    -compile time
    -cout
    -std

We will see if I actually choose to use this.

Syllabus

+------------------------------+
    **CONST** vs **CONSTEXPR**
    -const is a variable that can be initialized at runtime
    -constexpr must be initiliazed at compile time
    -both cannot be reassigned a value after initialization and are useful for unchanging values used frequently
        through out a program.

+------------------------------+
    [[fallthrough]]
    -Allows falling through into the next case in a switch-statement tree intentionally.
